QUE : *What is Bipartite graph?*
Ans : A Bipartite Graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two independent sets, 
U and V such that every edge (u, v) either connects a vertex from U to V or a vertex from V to U. 
In other words, for every edge (u, v), either u belongs to U and v to V, or u belongs to V and v to U. 
We can also say that there is no edge that connects vertices of same set.
